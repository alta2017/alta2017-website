        	<h2>Student Travel Support</h2>
		<p>Due to the generous support of our sponsors, ALTA will be offering travel support for students to attend and present at ALTA 2017 in Brisbane. The number of scholarships available, and their value, is still to be determined. These awards can be used to reimburse some of the travel and accommodation expenses. The organising committee reserves the right to make awards as they see fit, or to alter the amount of any awards. </p>
		<p>Students wishing to be considered for travel support must apply by email to the organizers (workshop@alta.asn.au). Preference will be given to students who will be presenting a paper at the workshop.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Students: How To Apply</h3>
		<p>In the email, you should briefly outline why you should get the award. Bullet points addressing the selection criteria below would be excellent. Be sure to include your name, your supervisor's name, and where you will be travelling from. Please provide a rough budget outline. (Awards will be provided with a specific limit amount; this is to give us some idea.)</p>
		<p>Please also arrange for your supervisor to send a separate email acknowledging that you are indeed enrolled as a student, and that the statements you made in the application are correct (to the best of their knowledge).</p>
		<p>Note that the award will be in the form of a reimbursement of expenses, not a cash award. The awardees will only receive money, up to the value of the award, after producing receipts for appropriate expenses, and completing any supplied forms.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>
		<p>Applications will be selected according to the following criteria.
		<ol type="1">
			<li>The student is presenting a paper at ALTA 2017.</li>
			<li>The student's host university and/or supervisor is unable to fund (or fully fund) the travel.</li>
			<li>The student will stay in budget accommodation during the conference.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>We may give preference to students who:</p>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>have not received the ALTA Student Travel Support in previous years.</li>
			<li>are nearing the end of their PhD candidature.</li>
		</ol>
		<br>
		<h3>Closing Date</h3>
