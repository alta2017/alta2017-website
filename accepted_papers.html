		<h3>Title: Characterising Information and Happiness in Online Social Activity</h3>
		<h4 id="mitchell">Speaker: Lewis Mitchell (Lecturer in Applied Mathematics, University of Adelaide)</h4>
		<p align="justify"> Lewis’s research focusses on large-scale methods for extracting useful information from online social networks, and on mathematical techniques for inference and prediction using these data. He works on building tools for real-time estimation of social phenomena such as happiness from written text, and prediction of population-level events like disease outbreaks, elections, and civil unrest.

		<h3>Title: Commercialised NLP: The State of the Art</h3>
		<h4 id="dale">Speaker: Robert Dale (Principal Consultant, Language Technology Group Pty Ltd)</h4>
		<p align="justify"> Robert Dale runs the Language Technology Group, an independent consultancy providing unbiased advice to corporations and businesses on the selection and deployment of NLP technologies.  Until recently, he was Chief Technology Officer of Arria NLG, where he led the development of a cloud-based natural language generation tool; prior to joining Arria in 2012, he held a chair in the Department of Computing at Macquarie University in Sydney, where he was Director of that university’s Centre for Language Technology.  After receiving his PhD from the University of Edinburgh in 1989, he taught there for several years before moving to Sydney in 1994.  He played a foundational role in building up the NLP community in Australia, and was editor in chief of the Computational Linguistics journal from 2003 to 2012. He writes a semi-regular column titled ‘Industry Watch’ for the Journal of Natural Language Engineering.
